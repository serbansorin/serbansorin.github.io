# Service Catalog

We assemble cross-functional pods that handle product discovery, delivery, and the launch runbook so you can stay focused on the mission. Each engagement is scoped around measurable outcomes, not feature checklists.

## Backend Engineering

- **Laravel & Filament** — Business applications with admin panels, dashboards, and workflows delivered in weeks, not months.
- **Django & FastAPI** — Python services for data-rich platforms, analytics backends, and AI model serving.
- **Golang Microservices** — High-throughput services for integrations, streaming, and heavy background processing.
- **Node.js & NestJS** — TypeScript-powered APIs, real-time gateways, and GraphQL orchestration.

### What you get
- Architecture tuned to your scaling window
- Automated testing and observability from the first sprint
- Documentation that in-house teams can extend

## Frontend Experience

- **React / Next.js / Remix** for product surfaces that stay fast under load and accessible across devices.
- **Vue & Nuxt** when teams prefer a lighter framework with opinionated DX.
- **Angular & TypeScript** for enterprise UI platforms that need structure and long-term governance.
- **Three.js and WebGL** for immersive data visualization and experiential marketing.

### Delivery focus
- Design systems that balance consistency with speed
- Performance budgets enforced through CI
- Internationalization and localization ready from day one

## Mobile Delivery

- **React Native + Expo** for shared codebases with modern native modules.
- **Flutter** for pixel-perfect branded experiences.
- **Kotlin Multiplatform & SwiftUI** when native access or platform-specific polish is critical.
- **Ionic / Capacitor** for pragmatic internal tools and field applications.

### Launch readiness
- Offline-first data syncing and secure storage
- App store submission support & release automation
- Analytics, crash reporting, and growth instrumentation baked in

## AI & Data Automation

- **OpenAI, Vertex AI, Hugging Face** integrations for copilots, summarization, and retrieval-augmented workflows.
- **LangChain, Temporal, Airflow** orchestration for agentic processes and asynchronous workloads.
- **Computer Vision & NLP** accelerators for document intake, classification, and quality control.
- **Predictive analytics pipelines** using Python, dbt, and modern data warehouses.

### Guardrails
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints and audit trails
- Usage monitoring with cost controls
- Bias evaluation and compliance reviews

## Cloud & DevOps

- **AWS / GCP / Azure** landing zones, networking, and security hardening.
- **Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, Cloud Run** deployments with automated rollbacks.
- **CI/CD** via GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI with quality gates and preview environments.
- **Observability** using Datadog, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, and custom SLO dashboards.

### Operations in orbit
- 24/7 monitoring playbooks and incident response runbooks
- Cost optimization passes and resource right-sizing
- Disaster recovery testing and compliance reporting

## Engagement Options

- **Discovery Sprints** (1–2 weeks) to validate scope, technical risk, and delivery roadmap.
- **Build Squads** (6–12 weeks) that embed with your product owner to deliver core functionality with documentation.
- **Enablement Tracks** that upskill internal teams on AI integration, DevOps, or design systems.
