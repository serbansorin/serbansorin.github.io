# About Synthkode

## Who We Are

Synthkode is a tight crew of product engineers, designers, and AI specialists who have shipped dozens of platforms for startups and innovation teams. We stay small on purpose so every engagement has direct access to decision-makers who still write code.

## Mission Principles

- **Product over output** — we start with business goals, not backlog items.
- **Reality-driven roadmaps** — honest estimates, transparent trade-offs, and weekly demos.
- **Embedded collaboration** — your product owner works shoulder-to-shoulder with our lead engineer and designer.
- **Responsible AI** — every automation ships with human oversight, audit trails, and measurable value.

## Core Crew Makeup

- Lead product engineer steering architecture and delivery cadence.
- Product designer who shapes flows, design systems, and usability tests.
- Applied AI specialist turning workflows into intelligent copilots.
- Cloud & DevOps engineer building resilient, observable infrastructure.
- Specialists from our orbit (QA, data engineering, content) as needed per sprint.

## How We Engage

1. **Launch Readiness Workshops** — clarify goals, stakeholder needs, and technical risks within the first week.
2. **Dual-Track Delivery** — design exploration and engineering happen together for faster validation.
3. **Production Launch & Transfer** — we deploy, monitor, and hand over with documentation, training, and dashboards.
4. **Optional On-Call Support** — fractional assistance for roadmap follow-through or team augmentation.

## What Partners Notice

- Workshops that translate strategy into actionable architecture within days.
- Decision logs and dashboards that keep founders, execs, and engineers aligned.
- Automation, tests, and cloud monitoring included in baseline scope.
- A calm, pragmatic approach that respects budgets and timelines.
